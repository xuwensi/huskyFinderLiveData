### `Problem description`

College is one of the most valuable time during people’s lifetime. Attending college, for many people, reflects the transition from childhood to adulthood, as well as finding the direction and goals for life. At the same time, college is also a challenge for most people: students has to go through a lot of stress and pain in order to survive through college, especially in academics. Therefore, finding a partner in college is very important for student to better prepare themselves for academic challenges. There are lots of [past experiences](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-to-have-a-learning-partner-while-studying) showing that studying with others is more efficient than studying along. But many college students, including me, find it very hard to find a study partner or a study group in college. Hence, we need an online space that helps students with different specialties to find the right study partner or study groups in college.

Currently, there are two major ways of finding a study partner in college: in the same class or through Facebook. But both has their own problems. Some students might just be too shy to ask for others in class, and using Facebook to find study partner is very slow and inefficient. Although there exists some websites like [Mooclab](https://www.mooclab.club/pages/study_buddy/) that help students to find partners, they have few users and it’s hard to find people from the same college.
